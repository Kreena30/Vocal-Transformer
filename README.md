# Vocal-Transformer: RealiTime voice character modification

# ABSTRACT:
This project documents the design of "Vocal Transformer," a real-time audio plug-in
for converting vocal inputs into diﬀerent character voices. For creating unique vocal
characters, such as robot, alien, child, giant, old, and choir voices, the plug-in
generates formant modification, pitch alteration, voice duplication, and audio
eﬀects. The plugin, developed with the JUCE framework, features a user interface
with parameterized controls for precision transformation adjustment.

# DESIGN:
The Vocal Transformer is designed around the concept of "character presets" -
predefined combinations of audio processing parameters that create recognizable
voice types. Each character can be further customized by adjusting individual
parameters, allowing for a wide range of possible transformations from subtle to
extreme.

# Character Voice Transformations:
Audio samples demonstrate the plugin's ability to transform voices.
